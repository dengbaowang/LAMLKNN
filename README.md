# LAMLKNN(A-Locally-Adaptive-Multi-Label-k-Nearest-Neighbor-Algorithm)
This is a implementation of the paper "A Locally Adaptive Multi-Label k-Nearest Neighbor Algorithm", which will be published in PAKDD'18.
The code will be uploaded after I back to school ( Now it's winter vocation in China 🤣).

Now the program can be download. This is a extension of ML-kNN algorithm, and the implementation is based on the original ML-kNN algorithm.

I have also uploaded a java version of LAML-kNN approach, this version is based on [Mulan](http://mulan.sourceforge.net/) Java library. You can copy the java file LAMLkNN.java into the file directory "\mulan\src\mulan\classifier\lazy\" and run it in Java IDE.
